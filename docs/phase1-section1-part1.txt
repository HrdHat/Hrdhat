1. FIELD LEVEL CLEAR
   - Small 'x' button appears in input field when it has content
   - Position: Right side of each input field
   - Visibility: Only shows when field has content
   - Action: Clears only that specific input field
   - No confirmation needed for individual field clear
   - Auto-saves when field is cleared

2. DELETE FORM BUTTON
   - Purpose: Remove entire form instance
   - Removes form from local storage
   - Requires confirmation dialog
   - Use case: Abandoning a form entirely
   - Returns user to form selection/creation

FORM STATE MANAGEMENT:
- Continuous auto-save as user types/makes changes
- Saves to local storage immediately after each change
- No explicit save button needed
- Handles all input types (text, checkboxes, dates, etc.)
- Preserves form state on page refresh/close
- Maintains separate drafts for multiple forms

FORM SUBMISSION FLOWS:

1. Normal Flow (Through Form Completion):
   - Submit button appears only after completing all modules
   - Not shown in form toolbar
   - Appears as "Send to Supervisor" at form completion
   - Guides user through validation before submission
   - Available in both guided and quick fill modes

2. Override Flow (Through Sidebar):
   - Access via sidebar "Active Forms" section
   - Shows list of all active forms
   - Each form entry has:
     * Form identifier/details
     * Delete (X) button
     * "Submit Form" button for immediate submission
   - Allows submission regardless of completion state
   - Used for end-of-shift or necessary early submissions

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Field 'x' button integrated into input field design
- Delete form button added to form-toolbar (left side)
- Submit functionality removed from form toolbar
- Delete requires confirmation dialog
- Submission state tracked per form

STYLING:
Field Clear (x):
- Small, subtle 'x' icon
- Only visible when field has content
- Hover effect for better UX
- Position absolute within input container

Delete Form:
- Use destructive action color (red variant)
- Include warning icon
- Position on left side of toolbar

Sidebar Active Forms:
- Clear list layout of active forms
- Each form row shows status/completion
- Delete and Submit actions clearly separated
- Submit button uses primary action color
- Delete (X) uses subtle destructive styling

CONFIRMATION DIALOG (Delete Form):
- Strong warning about permanent deletion
- Mention that this action cannot be undone
- Options: "Delete Form" / "Cancel"
