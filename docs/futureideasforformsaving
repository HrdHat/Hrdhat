Sounds good. Just for future reference, here are some minor things we could improve later:
Animation timing consistency - we have 300ms hardcoded in multiple places for transitions. We could move this to a constant or CSS variable.
Form saving logic - we have a placeholder comment // Here you could add logic to save the current form if needed in handleFormStateChange. We'll need to implement proper form state saving when we build out the form completion functionality.
Mobile-specific UX improvements:
Touch-friendly button sizes
Better handling of keyboard appearance for input fields
Possibly add swipe gestures for common actions
Consistent messaging - we could unify alert/confirm messages between mobile and desktop versions using a shared constants file.
The burger menu (â˜°) could be made into a reusable component since it appears in both versions.
Would you like to move on to implementing any other features or shall we keep these improvements noted for later?
