# Supabase Auth Signup: Best Practices vs. Your Code

## 1. Best Practice: Signup Flow

- User submits signup form (email, password, optional metadata).
- Frontend calls `supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password, options: { data: { ... } } })`.
- Supabase creates a new user in `auth.users`.
- (Optional) A trigger creates a row in `public.profiles` for the new user.
- User receives a confirmation email (if enabled).
- User confirms email, can now log in.
- Frontend does NOT insert into `profiles` directly.

---

## 2. Your Code: Signup Flow (as of latest review)

- User submits signup form (email, password, full name).
- `signUp` in `AuthContext.tsx` calls:

  ```ts
  const { error: signUpError } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
    email,
    password,
    options: { data: { full_name: fullName } }
  });
  if (signUpError) throw signUpError;
  // No manual insert into profiles (correct)
  ```
- Supabase creates a new user in `auth.users`.
- Your database trigger creates a row in `public.profiles` for the new user (using metadata for `full_name`).
- User receives a confirmation email (if enabled).
- User confirms email, can now log in.
- **No direct insert into `profiles` from frontend (correct).**

---

## 3. Best Practice: RLS and Triggers

- RLS on `profiles` allows:
  - Inserts where `auth.uid() = id` (user creates their own profile)
  - Inserts where `auth.uid() IS NULL` (trigger context)
- Trigger on `auth.users` automatically creates a `profiles` row after signup.
- No duplicate or orphaned rows in `profiles` or `auth.users`.

---

## 4. Your Code: RLS and Triggers

- RLS policy on `profiles`:
  ```sql
  create policy "Allow inserts for self or trigger"
    on public.profiles for insert
    with check (auth.uid() = id OR auth.uid() IS NULL);
  ```
- Trigger function `handle_new_user` creates a `profiles` row after signup.
- No manual insert from frontend (now correct).

---

## 5. Best Practice: Error Handling

- Show user-friendly error messages for signup/login issues.
- Log errors to the console for debugging.
- Prevent double submission of signup form (disable button while loading).

---

## 6. Your Code: Error Handling

- Uses `getSignUpErrorMessage` and `getLoginErrorMessage` for user-friendly errors.
- Logs errors to the console.
- Disables submit button while loading (prevents double submission).

---

## 7. Best Practice: Clean State for Testing

- Delete all users and profiles before testing new signups.
- Use a brand new email for each test.
- Hard refresh browser to clear cookies/local storage.

---

## 8. Your Code: Clean State

- You have deleted all users and profiles before testing.
- You are using new emails for each test.
- (If not, do a hard refresh to clear browser state.)

---

## 9. Issues Noted in Your Code/Flow

- Previously, you had a manual insert into `profiles` (now removed).
- If you see duplicate users in `auth.users`, it may be due to double submission or delayed deletion.
- If you see RLS errors, it was due to the manual insert (now fixed).
- If you see no user in `auth.users` after signup, the signup failed (check network tab and error messages).

---

## 10. Summary

- Your code now matches best practices for Supabase Auth signup and profile creation.
- If you follow the clean state steps and use a new email, signup should work and create both an Auth user and a profile row.
- If you see any issues, check the network tab, error messages, and Supabase dashboard for clues.
